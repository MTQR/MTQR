	abstract = {Abstract A method for constructing the exact quadratures for Müntz and Müntz-logarithmic polynomials is presented. The algorithm does permit to anticipate the precision (machine precision) of the numerical integration of Müntz-logarithmic polynomials in terms of the number of Gauss–Legendre (GL) quadrature samples and monomial transformation order. To investigate in depth the properties of classical GL quadrature, we present new optimal asymptotic estimates for the remainder. In boundary element integrals this quadrature rule can be applied to evaluate singular functions with end-point singularity, singular kernel as well as smooth functions. The method is numerically stable, efficient, easy to be implemented. The rule has been fully tested and several numerical examples are included. The proposed quadrature method is more efficient in run-time evaluation than the existing methods for Müntz polynomials. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

in the ISO C language, and based on the GNU MP library. Its particularity is to extend
to arbitrary-precision, ideas from the IEEE 754 standard, by providing correct rounding

slowdown with respect to other arbitrary-precision tools---and discuss a few applications
where such a library can be useful.},
