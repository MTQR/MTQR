numerical methods, are described for generating orthogonal polynomials relative to
arbitrary weight functions. The object of these routines is to produce the coefficients
in the three-term recurrence relation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials. Once
these are known, additional data can be generated, such as zeros of orthogonal polynomials
and Gauss-type quadrature rules, for which routines are also provided.},

in the ISO C language, and based on the GNU MP library. Its particularity is to extend
to arbitrary-precision, ideas from the IEEE 754 standard, by providing correct rounding
and exceptions. We demonstrate how these strong semantics are achieved---with no significant
slowdown with respect to other arbitrary-precision tools---and discuss a few applications
where such a library can be useful.},
