	abstract = {Abstract A method for constructing the exact quadratures for Müntz and Müntz-logarithmic polynomials is presented. The algorithm does permit to anticipate the precision (machine precision) of the numerical integration of Müntz-logarithmic polynomials in terms of the number of Gauss–Legendre (GL) quadrature samples and monomial transformation order. To investigate in depth the properties of classical GL quadrature, we present new optimal asymptotic estimates for the remainder. In boundary element integrals this quadrature rule can be applied to evaluate singular functions with end-point singularity, singular kernel as well as smooth functions. The method is numerically stable, efficient, easy to be implemented. The rule has been fully tested and several numerical examples are included. The proposed quadrature method is more efficient in run-time evaluation than the existing methods for Müntz polynomials. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

numerical methods, are described for generating orthogonal polynomials relative to
arbitrary weight functions. The object of these routines is to produce the coefficients
in the three-term recurrence relation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials. Once
these are known, additional data can be generated, such as zeros of orthogonal polynomials
and Gauss-type quadrature rules, for which routines are also provided.},

abstract = {This article presents a multiple-precision binary floating-point library, written
in the ISO C language, and based on the GNU MP library. Its particularity is to extend
to arbitrary-precision, ideas from the IEEE 754 standard, by providing correct rounding
and exceptions. We demonstrate how these strong semantics are achieved---with no significant
slowdown with respect to other arbitrary-precision tools---and discuss a few applications
where such a library can be useful.},
