Following files are included:

besselintc.m
       Matlab function to compute the infinite range integral of an
       arbitrary product of Bessel functions and an exponential factor.
       This script does not require special Matlab toolboxes.

besselintr.m
       Matlab function to compute the infinite range integral of an
       arbitrary product of Bessel functions and a rational factor.
       This script does not require special Matlab toolboxes.

igamma.m
       Implementation of the incomplete Gamma function for arbitrary
       complex arguments.

perprofc.m
       Test program which demonstrates the use of besselintc.m for
       several examples.

perprofr.m
       Test program which demonstrates the use of besselintr.m for
       several examples.

README
       This README file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the test programs, start Matlab or Octave and move to the directory
where you installed the code (or add this directory to the path).
Then type

> perprofr

or

> perprofc

at the prompt, to test besselintr or besselintc respectively.

In Matlab version 7.2.0.232 (R2006a), on a Dell Latitude laptop with
Intel CPU T2300 processor (1.62 GHz), under Windows XP pro, timings are
as follows:

- perprofc:  57 seconds
- perprofr: 447 seconds

In Octave or older versions of Matlab, or on older computers, this may
take much longer.
